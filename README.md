# pyosim_aws
Using pyosim and AWS to perform batch musculoskeletal analysis on the cloud

## About
See [Index.ipynb](./notebooks/Index.ipynb) for an index of the notebooks available to accompany the text.

## Software
The packages we used to run the code are listed in [environment.yml](environment.yml).

To create a stand-alone environment named `pyosim_aws` with Python and all the required package versions, run the following:

```bash
$ conda env create -n pyosim_aws -f environment.yml
```

You can read more about using conda environments in the [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) section of the conda documentation.
