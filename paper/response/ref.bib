    author = "van der Molen, Henk F and Foresti, Chiara and Daams, Joost G and
              Frings-Dresen, Monique H W and Kuijer, P Paul F M",
    abstract = "The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to
              examine which work-related risk factors are associated with
              specific soft tissue shoulder disorders. We searched the
              electronic databases of Medline and Embase for articles published
              between 2009 and 24 March 2016 and included the references of a
              systematic review performed for the period before 2009. Primary
              cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included when
              outcome data were described in terms of clinically assessed soft
              tissue shoulder disorders and at least two levels of work-related
              exposure were mentioned (exposed vs less or non-exposed). Two
              authors independently selected studies, extracted data and
              assessed study quality. For longitudinal studies, we performed
              meta-analyses and used GRADE (Grades of Recommendations,
              Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to assess the evidence
              for the associations between risk factors and the onset of
              shoulder disorders. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion
              criteria. In total, 16 300 patients with specific soft tissue
              shoulder disorders from a population of 2 413 722 workers from
              Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and Poland were included in the
              meta-analysis of one case-control and six prospective cohort
              studies. This meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence for
              associations between shoulder disorders and arm-hand elevation
              (OR=1.9, 95\% CI 1.47 to 2.47) and shoulder load (OR=2.0, 95\% CI
              1.90 to 2.10) and low to very low evidence for hand force
              exertion (OR=1.5, 95\% CI 1.25 to 1.87), hand-arm vibration
              (OR=1.3, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.77), psychosocial job demands (OR=1.1,
              95\% CI 1.01 to 1.25) and working together with temporary workers
              (OR=2.2, 95\% CI 1.2 to 4.2). Low-quality evidence for no
              associations was found for arm repetition, social support,
              decision latitude, job control and job security. Moderate
              evidence was found that arm-hand elevation and shoulder load
              double the risk of specific shoulder disorders. Low to
              very-low-quality evidence was found for an association between
              hand force exertion, hand-arm vibration, psychosocial job demands
              and working together with temporary workers and the incidence of
              specific shoulder disorders.",
