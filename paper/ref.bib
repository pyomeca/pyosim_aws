    abstract = "Crouch gait, a common walking pattern in individuals with
              cerebral palsy, is characterized by excessive flexion of the hip
              and knee. Many subjects with crouch gait experience knee pain,
              perhaps because of elevated muscle forces and joint loading. The
              goal of this study was to examine how muscle forces and
              compressive tibiofemoral force change with the increasing knee
              flexion associated with crouch gait. Muscle forces and
              tibiofemoral force were estimated for three unimpaired children
              and nine children with cerebral palsy who walked with varying
              degrees of knee flexion. We scaled a generic musculoskeletal
              model to each subject and used the model to estimate muscle
              forces and compressive tibiofemoral forces during walking. Mild
              crouch gait (minimum knee flexion 20-35°) produced a peak
              compressive tibiofemoral force similar to unimpaired walking;
              however, severe crouch gait (minimum knee flexion>50°) increased
              the peak force to greater than 6 times body-weight, more than
              double the load experienced during unimpaired gait. This increase
              in compressive tibiofemoral force was primarily due to increases
              in quadriceps force during crouch gait, which increased
              quadratically with average stance phase knee flexion (i.e.,
              crouch severity). Increased quadriceps force contributes to
              larger tibiofemoral and patellofemoral loading which may

    author = "Waters, Thomas and Occhipinti, Enrico and Colombini, Daniela and
              Alvarez-Casado, Enrique and Fox, Robert",
    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We seek to develop a new approach for analyzing the
              physical demands of highly variable lifting tasks through an
              adaptation of the Revised NIOSH (National Institute for
              Occupational Safety and Health) Lifting Equation (RNLE) into a
              Variable Lifting Index (VLI). BACKGROUND: There are many jobs
              that contain individual lifts that vary from lift to lift due to
              the task requirements. The NIOSH Lifting Equation is not suitable
              in its present form to analyze variable lifting tasks. METHOD: In
              extending the prior work on the VLI, two procedures are presented
              to allow users to analyze variable lifting tasks. One approach
              involves the sampling of lifting tasks performed by a worker over
              a shift and the calculation of the Frequency Independent Lift
              Index (FILI) for each sampled lift and the aggregation of the
              FILI values into six categories. The Composite Lift Index (CLI)
              equation is used with lifting index (LI) category frequency data
              to calculate the VLI. The second approach employs a detailed
              systematic collection of lifting task data from production and/or
              organizational sources. The data are organized into simplified
              task parameter categories and further aggregated into six FILI
              categories, which also use the CLI equation to calculate the VLI.
              RESULTS: The two procedures will allow practitioners to
              systematically employ the VLI method to a variety of work
              situations where highly variable lifting tasks are performed.
              CONCLUSIONS: The scientific basis for the VLI procedure is
              similar to that for the CLI originally presented by NIOSH;
              however, the VLI method remains to be validated. APPLICATION: The
              VLI method allows an analyst to assess highly variable manual
              lifting jobs in which the task characteristics vary from lift to
              lift during a shift.",

              the trunk and lower limb, although women present a higher
              prevalence of shoulder disorders. We investigated sex differences
              in the upper limb technique during a lifting task. Trunk and
              upper limb kinematics were recorded in 27 women and 27 men
              lifting a box (6 or 12 kg) from hip to eye level. Work technique
              was quantified through the three-dimensional contribution of each
              joint to overall box height. The glenohumeral joint showed a
              higher contribution in women with a 6 kg box and wrist and elbow
              joints did with a 12 kg box, compared to men at either 6 or 12

              assessment requires an understanding of the incidence and
              prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the community, of the
              reasons why people consult in primary care, and of the proportion
              of people who would benefit from referral to secondary care and
              paramedical services. This paper reports the first phase of such
              a needs assessment exercise. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE: To estimate the
              relative frequency of musculoskeletal pain in different, and
              multiple, anatomical sites in the adult population. SETTING:
              Three general practices in the former Tameside and Glossop Health
              Authority, Greater Manchester, UK, a predominantly urban area.
              DESIGN: Population survey. METHODS: An age and sex stratified
              sample of 6000 adults from the three practices was mailed a
              questionnaire that sought data on demographic factors,
              musculoskeletal symptoms (pain in the past month lasting for more
              than a week), and physical disability (using the modified Health
              Assessment Questionnaire--mHAQ). The areas of pain covered were
              neck, back, shoulder, elbow, hand, hip, knee, and multiple
              joints. The Carstairs index was used as a measure of social
              deprivation of the postcode sector in which the person lived.
              RESULTS: The response rate after two reminders was 78.5\%.
              Non-responders were more likely to live in areas of high social
              deprivation. People who lived in more deprived areas were also
              more likely to report musculoskeletal pain, especially backpain.
              After adjusting for social deprivation the rates of
              musculoskeletal pain did not differ between the practices and so
              their results were combined. After adjustment for social
              deprivation, the most common site of pain was back (23\%; 95\% CI
              21, 25) followed by knee (19\%; 95\% CI 18, 21), and shoulder
              (16\%; 95\% CI 14, 17). The majority of subjects who reported
              pain had pain in more than one site. The prevalence of physical
              disability in the community rose with age. It was highest in
              those with multiple joint problems but was also high in those
              with isolated back or knee pain. CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal pain
              is common in the community. People who live in socially deprived
              areas have more musculoskeletal symptoms. Estimates of the
              overall burden of musculoskeletal pain that combine the results
              of site specific surveys will be too high, those that do not
              adjust for socioeconomic factors will be too low.",

              levels that occur frequently in industrial work. High-precision
              spatial recordings were accomplished with a three-dimensional
              motion-analysis system, and the IMP was measured using the
              microcapillary infusion technique. The mean IMP of the

              self-administered instrument designed to assess the level of
              functional disability in individuals with back pain. The scale
              was administered as part of a larger questionnaire to a group of
              242 back pain patients. Follow-up data were obtained after
              several days and after 2 to 6 months. OBJECTIVES: The goal of
              this study was to determine whether the Quebec scale is a
              reliable, valid, and responsive measure of disability in back
              pain, and to compare it with other disability scales. SUMMARY OF
              BACKGROUND DATA: A number of functional disability scales for
              back pain are being used, but their conceptual validity is
              uncertain. Unlike most published instruments, the Quebec scale
              was constructed using a conceptual approach to disability
              assessment and empirical methods of item development, analysis,
              and selection. METHODS: The authors calculated test-retest and
              internal consistency coefficients, evaluated construct validity
              of the scale, and tested its responsiveness against a global
              index of change. Direct comparisons with the Roland, Oswestry,
              and SF-36 scales were carried out. RESULTS: Test-retest
              reliability was 0.92, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.96.
              The scale correlated as expected with other measures of
              disability, pain, medical history, and utilization variables,
              work-related variables, and socio-demographic characteristics.
              Significant changes in disability over time, and differences in
              change scores between patients that were expected to differ in
              the direction of change, were found. CONCLUSIONS: The Quebec
              scale can be recommended as an outcome measure in clinical
              trials, and for monitoring the progress of individual patients
              participating in treatment or rehabilitation programs.",

              for the statistical analysis of data from functional neuroimaging

              functional neuroimaging literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J

              accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the
              standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing framework. When the
              appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation
              approach gives results similar to those obtained from a
              comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a
              general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections
              derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees

              multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population
              effects, the nonparametric approach employing a locally pooled
              (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform the comparable
              Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these
              nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of
              less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although
              the theory and relative advantages of permutation approaches have
              been discussed by various authors, there has been no accessible

              applications of the technique. This article, and the accompanying
              MATLAB software, attempts to address these issues. The standard
              nonparametric randomization and permutation testing ideas are
              developed at an accessible level, using practical examples from
              functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple
              comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI
              are presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard
              parametric approaches made where appropriate. Practical

              studies, published since 1990, were identified by screening
              citations from 35 earlier systematic reviews and by searching

              intervention category and other features, including study
              quality. RESULTS: Among 42 studies (including 34 RCTs), 27
              assessed return to work (RTW), 21 duration of sickness absence
              and 5 job loss. Interventions included exercise therapy,
              behavioural change techniques, workplace adaptations and
              provision of additional services. Studies were typically small
              \{median sample 107 [inter-quartile range (IQR) 77-148]\} and
              limited in quality. Most interventions appeared beneficial: the
              median relative risk (RR) for RTW was 1.21 (IQR 1.00-1.60) and
              that for avoiding MSD-related job loss was 1.25 (IQR 1.06-1.71);
              the median reduction in sickness absence was 1.11 (IQR 0.32-3.20)

              doubtful cost-effectiveness, employers' practice should be guided
              by their value judgements about the uncertainties. Expensive
              interventions should be implemented only with rigorous
              cost-benefit evaluation planned from the outset. Future research

              Static work seems to induce symptoms at an earlier age. The

    abstract = "Estimation of individual muscle forces during human movement can
              provide insight into neural control and tissue loading and can
              thus contribute to improved diagnosis and management of both
              neurological and orthopaedic conditions. Direct measurement of
              muscle forces is generally not feasible in a clinical setting,
              and non-invasive methods based on musculoskeletal modeling should
              therefore be considered. The current state of the art in clinical
              movement analysis is that resultant joint torques can be reliably
              estimated from motion data and external forces (inverse dynamic
              analysis). Static optimization methods to transform joint torques
              into estimates of individual muscle forces using musculoskeletal
              models, have been known for several decades. To date however,
              none of these methods have been successfully translated into
              clinical practice. The main obstacles are the lack of studies
              reporting successful validation of muscle force estimates, and
              the lack of user-friendly and efficient computer software. Recent
              advances in forward dynamics methods have opened up new
              opportunities. Forward dynamic optimization can be performed such
              that solutions are less dependent on measured kinematics and
              ground reaction forces, and are consistent with additional
              knowledge, such as the force-length-velocity-activation
              relationships of the muscles, and with observed electromyography
              signals during movement. We conclude that clinical applications
              of current research should be encouraged, supported by further

              and can be measured with a handheld dynamometer. Reference values
              are employed to quantify a subject's muscle force. It is not
              unambiguous whether reference values can be generalized to other
              populations. Objectives in this study were; first to confirm the
              reliability of the utilization of hand-held dynamometers for
              isometric strength measurement; second to determine reference
              values for a population of Dutch workers; third to compare these
              values with those of a USA population. METHODS: 462 Healthy
              working subjects (259 male, 203 female) were included in this
              study. Their age ranged from 20 to 60 years with a mean (sd) of
              41 (11) years. Muscle force values from elbow flexion and
              extension, knee flexion and extension, and shoulder abduction
              were measured with the break method using a MicroFet 2 hand-held
              dynamometer. Reliability was analyzed by calculating ICC's and
              limits of agreement. Muscle force expressed in Newton, means, and
              confidence intervals were determined for males and females in age
              groups ranging from twenty to sixty years old. Regression
              equations and explained variances were calculated from weight,
              height, age, and gender. The mean values and 95\% CI were
              compared to the results from other studies. RESULTS: Reliability
              was good; the ICC ranged between 0.83 to 0.94. The explained
              variance ranged from 0.25 to 0.51. Comparison of data for the
              Dutch population mean muscle force values with those from the USA

              Muscle force measurements demonstrate a sound reliability.

              reviewed the current literature on lifting, recommend criteria
              for defining lifting capacity, and in 1991 developed a revised
              lifting equation. Subsequently, NIOSH developed the documentation
              for the equation and played a prominent role in recommending
              methods for interpreting the results of the equation. The 1991
              equation reflects new findings and provides methods for
              evaluating asymmetrical lifting tasks, lifts of objects with less
              than optimal hand-container couplings, and also provides
              guidelines for a larger range of work durations and lifting
              frequencies than the 1981 equation. This paper provides the basis
              for selecting the three criteria (biomechanical, physiological,
              and psychophysical) that were used to define the 1991 equation,
              and describes the derivation of the individual components
              (Putz-Anderson and Waters 1991). The paper also describes the
              lifting index (LI), an index of relative physical stress, that
              can be used to identify hazardous lifting tasks. Although the
              1991 equation has not been fully validated, the recommended
              weight limits derived from the revised equation are consistent
              with or lower than those generally reported in the literature.
              NIOSH believes that the revised 1991 lifting equation is more

               injury risk by affecting shoulder load and stability. We
               assessed the effects of sex (25 women vs 26 men) and lifting
               load (6 kg vs 12 kg) on muscle activation during box lifting
               from hip to eye level. Surface and intramuscular
               electromyography were recorded from 10 glenohumeral muscles.
               Most muscles were more activated for the heavier box and for
               women. These effects were larger for 'prime movers' than for
               stabilisers and antagonists. Despite their apparently
               heterogeneous effects on muscle activity, sex and mass did not
               affect Muscle Focus, a metric of coactivation. This may be
               partly related to the limited sensitivity of the Muscle Focus.
               Nevertheless, sex differences in strength, more than in
               coactivation patterns, may contribute to the sex imbalance in

              particular, we review a general process for verification and
              validation applied to NMS models and simulations, including
              careful formulation of a research question and methods,
              traditional verification and validation steps, and documentation
              and sharing of results for use and testing by other researchers.
              Modeling the NMS system and simulating its motion involves
              methods to represent neural control, musculoskeletal geometry,
              muscle-tendon dynamics, contact forces, and multibody dynamics.
              For each of these components, we review modeling choices and
              software verification guidelines; discuss variability, errors,
              uncertainty, and sensitivity relationships; and provide
              recommendations for verification and validation by comparing
              experimental data and testing robustness. We present a series of
              case studies to illustrate key principles. In closing, we discuss
              challenges the community must overcome to ensure that modeling
              and simulation are successfully used to solve the broad spectrum
              of problems that limit human mobility.",

    abstract = "For many clinical applications it is necessary to non-invasively
              determine shoulder motion during dynamic movements, and in such
              cases skin markers are favoured. However, as skin markers may not
              accurately track the underlying bone motion the methods currently
              used must be refined. Furthermore, to determine the motion of the
              shoulder a model is required to relate the obtained marker
              trajectories to the shoulder kinematics. In Wu et al. (2005) the
              International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) proposed a shoulder
              model based on the position of bony landmarks. A limitation of
              the ISB recommendations is that the reference positions of the
              shoulder joints are not standardized. The aims of this research
              project were to develop a method to accurately determine shoulder
              kinematics using skin markers, and to investigate the effect of
              introduction of a standardized reference configuration. Fifteen
              subjects, free from shoulder pathology, performed arm elevations
              while skin marker trajectories were tracked. Shoulder kinematics
              were reconstructed using a chain model and extended Kalman

              kinematics obtained with and without introduction of the

              0° for 0° of humerus elevation when the reference configuration

    abstract = "The rotator cuff performs multiple functions during shoulder
              exercises, including glenohumeral abduction, external rotation
              (ER) and internal rotation (IR). The rotator cuff also stabilizes
              the glenohumeral joint and controls humeral head translations.
              The infraspinatus and subscapularis have significant roles in
              scapular plane abduction (scaption), generating forces that are
              two to three times greater than supraspinatus force. However, the
              supraspinatus still remains a more effective shoulder abductor
              because of its more effective moment arm. Both the deltoids and
              rotator cuff provide significant abduction torque, with an
              estimated contribution up to 35-65\% by the middle deltoid, 30\%
              by the subscapularis, 25\% by the supraspinatus, 10\% by the
              infraspinatus and 2\% by the anterior deltoid. During abduction,
              middle deltoid force has been estimated to be 434 N, followed by
              323 N from the anterior deltoid, 283 N from the subscapularis,
              205 N from the infraspinatus, and 117 N from the supraspinatus.
              These forces are generated not only to abduct the shoulder but
              also to stabilize the joint and neutralize the antagonistic
              effects of undesirable actions. Relatively high force from the
              rotator cuff not only helps abduct the shoulder but also
              neutralizes the superior directed force generated by the deltoids
              at lower abduction angles. Even though anterior deltoid force is
              relatively high, its ability to abduct the shoulder is low due to
              a very small moment arm, especially at low abduction angles. The
              deltoids are more effective abductors at higher abduction angles
              while the rotator cuff muscles are more effective abductors at
              lower abduction angles. During maximum humeral elevation the
              scapula normally upwardly rotates 45-55 degrees, posterior tilts
              20-40 degrees and externally rotates 15-35 degrees. The scapular
              muscles are important during humeral elevation because they cause
              these motions, especially the serratus anterior, which
              contributes to scapular upward rotation, posterior tilt and ER.
              The serratus anterior also helps stabilize the medial border and
              inferior angle of the scapular, preventing scapular IR (winging)
              and anterior tilt. If normal scapular movements are disrupted by
              abnormal scapular muscle firing patterns, weakness, fatigue, or
              injury, the shoulder complex functions less efficiency and injury
              risk increases. Scapula position and humeral rotation can affect
              injury risk during humeral elevation. Compared with scapular
              protraction, scapular retraction has been shown to both increase
              subacromial space width and enhance supraspinatus force
              production during humeral elevation. Moreover, scapular IR and
              scapular anterior tilt, both of which decrease subacromial space
              width and increase impingement risk, are greater when performing
              scaption with IR ('empty can') compared with scaption with ER
              ('full can'). There are several exercises in the literature that
              exhibit high to very high activity from the rotator cuff,
              deltoids and scapular muscles, such as prone horizontal abduction
              at 100 degrees abduction with ER, flexion and abduction with ER,
              'full can' and 'empty can', D1 and D2 diagonal pattern flexion
              and extension, ER and IR at 0 degrees and 90 degrees abduction,
              standing extension from 90-0 degrees , a variety of
              weight-bearing upper extremity exercises, such as the push-up,
              standing scapular dynamic hug, forward scapular punch, and rowing
              type exercises. Supraspinatus activity is similar between 'empty
              can' and 'full can' exercises, although the 'full can' results in
              less risk of subacromial impingement. Infraspinatus and
              subscapularis activity have generally been reported to be higher
              in the 'full can' compared with the 'empty can', while posterior
              deltoid activity has been reported to be higher in the 'empty

              that, in certain situations, such schemes can compromise the
              spatiotemporal integrity of the original fields. An alternative
              methodology called statistical parametric mapping (SPM), designed
              specifically for continuous field analysis, constructs
              statistical images that lie in the original, biomechanically
              meaningful sampling space. The current paper demonstrates how SPM
              can be used to analyze both experimental and simulated
              biomechanical field data of arbitrary spatiotemporal
              dimensionality. Firstly, 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional
              spatiotemporal datasets derived from a pedobarographic experiment
              were analyzed using a common linear model to emphasize that SPM
              procedures are (practically) identical irrespective of the data's
              physical dimensionality. Secondly two probabilistic finite
              element simulation studies were conducted, examining heel pad

              how SPM can be used to probe the significance of field-wide
              simulation results in the presence of uncontrollable or induced

              suggest that SPM may be suitable for a wide variety of mechanical
              field applications. SPM's main theoretical advantage is that it
              avoids problems associated with a priori assumptions regarding
              the spatiotemporal foci of field signals. SPM's main practical
              advantage is that a unified framework, encapsulated by a single

               shoulder pain in Alberta, focusing particularly on ergonomic
               risk factors. METHODS: A case referent design was used to
               compare individuals who made a Workers' Compensation Board (WCB)
               claim for work-related shoulder pain with individuals who made a
               claim for other types of injury. Data were collected using a
               postal questionnaire and analysed by logistic regression.
               RESULTS: There were 1263 participants (562 cases, 701
               referents). The participation rate was 25\% among cases and 21\%
               among referents (P < 0.01). Factors associated with an increased

              from lifting experiments on 12 female and 10 male participants
              were examined. The participants performed squat and stoop lifts
              of a box. Movements were measured by means of opto-electronic
              measurement systems. Kinematic data derived from the measurements
              revealed some differences between the men and the women, e.g. in
              trunk motion and knee angle ranges. The hip-knee interjoint
              coordination was more synchronized for women than for men in
              terms of the relative phase angle. It is concluded that so far
              gender differences in motion patterns have not been sufficiently
              explored and that men and women need to be considered separately
              in the evaluation of work technique in manual handling tasks.

              need to be further investigated.",

              employed workers. METHODS: Two year prospective study of newly
              employed workers from 12 diverse occupational settings. At
              baseline, 1081 subjects provided information on work related
              mechanical and psychosocial risk factors, and current pain
              status. RESULTS: In all, 803 (74\%) subjects were free from
              shoulder pain at baseline. Of those, 638 (79\%) responded at 12
              months and 476 (88\%) at 24 months. New onset shoulder pain was
              reported by 93 (15\%) and 73 (15\%) subjects respectively. An
              increased risk of symptom onset was found in subjects reporting
              mechanical exposures involving heavy weights including lifting
              with one or two hands, carrying on one shoulder, lifting at or
              above shoulder level, and pushing or pulling. Working with hands
              above shoulder level was also predictive of new onset shoulder
              pain. Of the psychosocial factors examined, the strongest
              predictor was monotonous work. Those individuals with any other
              previous pain also had an increased risk of new onset shoulder
              pain at follow up. In multivariate analysis, lifting heavy
              weights with one or two hands, pushing or pulling heavy weights,
              working with hands above shoulder level, and monotonous work were
              independently associated with new onset shoulder pain.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesised relation
              between mechanical risk factors and shoulder pain. In general,
              work related psychosocial factors were modestly associated with
              new onset shoulder pain. However, monotonous work was a strong

              the upper-limb muscle forces. A reference movement was generated,

              Random noise was added to both simulated EMG and marker
              trajectories in order to create 30 trials. Then, muscle forces
              were estimated using (1) the innovative EMG-marker tracking
              forward optimisation, (2) a marker tracking forward optimisation
              with a least-excitation criterion, and (3) static optimisation
              with a least-activation criterion. Approaches (1) and (2) were

              reference and estimated joint angles and muscle forces for the
              three optimisations were statistically compared using
              root-mean-square errors (RMSEs), biases, and statistical
              parametric mapping. The joint angles RMSEs were qualitatively

              loading on the human skeleton, which cannot directly be measured
              in vivo, from external measurements like kinematics and external
              forces. Such models of the shoulder and upper extremity have been
              used for a variety of purposes, ranging from understanding basic
              shoulder biomechanics to assisting in preoperative planning. In
              this review, we provide an overview of the most commonly used
              large-scale shoulder and upper extremity models and categorise
              the applications of these models according to the type of
              questions their users aimed to answer. We found that the most
              explored feature of a model is the possibility to predict the
              effect of a structural adaptation on functional outcome, for
              instance, to simulate a tendon transfer preoperatively. Recent
              studies have focused on minimising the mismatch in morphology
              between the model, often derived from cadaver studies, and the
              subject that is analysed. However, only a subset of the
              parameters that describe the model's geometry and, perhaps most
              importantly, the musculotendon properties can be obtained in
              vivo. Because most parameters are somehow interrelated, the
              others should be scaled to prevent inconsistencies in the model's
              structure, but it is not known exactly how. Although considerable
              effort is put into adding complexity to models, for example, by
              making them subject-specific, we have found little evidence of
              their superiority over current models. The current trend in
              development towards individualised, more complex models needs to
              be justified by demonstrating their ability to answer questions

              16 participants who performed isometric and dynamic shoulder
              exertions in three shoulder planes (flexion, mid-abduction and
              abduction) covering four shoulder elevation angles (30 degrees ,
              60 degrees , 90 degrees and 120 degrees). Shoulder exertions were
              performed under three hand load conditions: no load, holding a
              0.5 kg load and 30\% grip. It was found that adding a 0.5 kg load
              to the hand increased shoulder muscle activity by 4\% maximum

              effects of lifting frequency have focused on whole-body
              measurements of fatigue or subjective acceptance of the task and
              have not considered how spine loads may change as a function of
              lift frequency or lift time exposure. Our understanding of
              biomechanical spine loading has been extrapolated from short
              lifting bouts to the entire work day and may have led us to
              incorrect assumptions. The objective of this project was to
              document how spine loading changes as a function of experience,
              lift frequency, and lift duration while repetitively lifting over
              the course of an 8-h workday. METHODS: Twelve novice and twelve
              experienced manual materials handlers performed repetitive,
              asymmetric lifts at different load and lift frequency levels
              throughout an 8-h exposure period. Compression,
              anterior-posterior shear, and lateral shear were evaluated over
              the lifting period using an EMG-assisted biomechanical model.
              RESULTS: Spinal loads increased after the first 2 h of lifting
              exposure regardless of the lift frequency. Loading was also
              greater for the inexperienced subjects compared to experienced
              lifters. The greatest spine loads occurred at those lift
              frequencies and weights to which the workers were unaccustomed.
              INTERPRETATION: Increases in spine loading were tracked back to
              the changes in muscle recruitment patterns that typically
              involved increased muscle coactivation. The results emphasize the
              importance of previous motor programming in defining spine loads

              different influence of frequency and lift time exposure compared
              to physiologic and psychophysical assessments. This study has
              shown that it is not sufficient to extrapolate from short lift

              47.2 yr) males participated in the study. Participants
              repetitively lifted a box weighing 13 kg at a frequency of 10
              lifts/min for a maximum of 20 min. Postural kinematics (joint and
              lumbosacral angles and angular velocities) and kinetics (joint
              moments) were measured throughout the lifting task using motion
              analysis and ground reaction forces. Muscle fatigue of the
              erector spinae was assessed using electromyography. FINDINGS:
              Peak lumbosacral, trunk, hip and knee flexion angles differed
              significantly between age groups over the duration of the task,
              as did lumbosacral and trunk angular velocities. The younger

              increase in peak lumbosacral and trunk angular velocities during

              muscles during a lifting task. Kinematics and muscle
              electromyograms (n = 9) were recorded from 13 healthy adults
              during a bi-manual lifting task performed from the hip to the
              shoulder level. A generic upper-limb OpenSim model was
              implemented to simulate glenohumeral stability and instability by
              performing static optimizations with and without glenohumeral
              stability constraints. This procedure enabled to compute the
              level of shoulder muscle activity and forces in the two
              conditions. Without the stability constraint, the simulated
              movement was unstable during 74\%$\pm$16\% of the time. The force
              of the supraspinatus was significantly increased of 107\%
              (p<0.002) when the glenohumeral stability constraint was
              implemented. The increased supraspinatus force led to greater
              compressive force (p<0.001) and smaller shear force (p<0.001),
              which contributed to improved glenohumeral stability. It was
              concluded that the supraspinatus may be the main contributor to
              glenohumeral stability during lifting task.",

               comprehensive national survey was carried out among a
               representative sample (n = 7217) of the Finnish adult population
               in 1977-80. Twenty years later, 1286 participants from the

               participated. After excluding those with diagnosed shoulder
               disorders at baseline, 883 subjects were available for the
               analyses. RESULTS: At follow-up, a physician diagnosed chronic
               shoulder disorders in 63 subjects (7\%) using a standardised
               protocol. Work exposure to repetitive movements and vibration at

               Exposure to several physical factors increased the risk further,
               the adjusted OR was nearly 4 for at least three exposures. The
               adverse effects of physical work were seen even among those
               older than 75 years at follow-up. The statistically significant

              squared, and which generated the joint moments input from the
              dynamic solution. In the first static problem, muscles were
              treated as ideal force generators; in the second, they were
              constrained by their force-length-velocity properties; and in
              both, activation dynamics was neglected. In terms of predicted
              muscle forces and joint contact forces, the dynamic and static
              solutions were remarkably similar. Also, activation dynamics and
              the force-length-velocity properties of muscle had little
              influence on the static solutions. Thus, for normal gait, if one
              can accurately solve the inverse dynamics problem and if one
              seeks only to estimate muscle forces, the use of dynamic
              optimization rather than static optimization is currently not
              justified. Scenarios in which the use of dynamic optimization is
              justified are suggested.",

               workers in five activity sectors completed a self administered
               questionnaire in 1993-94 and again three years later. Both

               pain at baseline. RESULTS: The incidence of shoulder pain was
               associated with several independent risk factors: depressive
               symptoms, low level of job control, and biomechanical
               constraints. After adjustment for other risk factors, the

               onset of shoulder pain in both sexes. For men, repetitive use of

              A recent study showed that female workers differed from males
              mostly in the strategy they used to lift 15-kg boxes from the
              ground, especially regarding task duration, knee and back
              postures and interjoint coordination. However, the lifting
              technique difference observed in females compared to males was
              perhaps due to a strength differences. The objective of this
              study was to test whether female workers would repeat the same
              lifting technique with a load adjusted to their overall strength
              (females: 10 kg; males: 15 kg), which can be considered a
              ``relative load'' since the overall back strength of females is
              2/3 that of males. The task for the participants consisted in
              transferring boxes from one pallet to another. A dynamic 3D
              linked segment model was used to estimate the net moments at
              L5/S1, and different kinematic variables were considered. The
              results showed that the biomechanics of the lifting techniques

              and cumulative loading, but different in terms of interjoint

              pattern previously seen in females with an absolute load (15 kg)
              was still present with the relative load, suggesting the
              influence of factors more intrinsically linked to sex.
              Considering that the female coordination pattern likely stretched
              posterior passive tissues when lifting boxes from the ground,
              potentially leading to higher risk of injury, the reason for this

              represented as an ideal three degree-of-freedom ball-and-socket
              joint. The articulation between the scapula and thorax was
              modeled using two kinematic constraints. Eighteen muscle bundles
              were used to represent the lines of action of 11 muscle groups
              spanning the glenohumeral joint. The three-dimensional positions
              of the clavicle, scapula, and humerus during abduction were
              measured using intracortical bone pins implanted into one

              cuff muscles (specifically, supraspinatus, subscapularis, and

              positioned to apply compressive load across the glenohumeral
              joint, and that these muscles contribute most significantly to
              shoulder joint stability during abduction. The middle deltoid
              provides most of the compressive force acting between the humeral
              head and the glenoid, but this muscle also creates most of the
              shear, and so its contribution to joint stability is less than
              that of any of the rotator cuff muscles.",

              (1D) trajectories. It has been shown that 1D confidence intervals
              (CIs) are biased when based on 0D statistical procedures, and the
              non-parametric 1D bootstrap CI has emerged in the Biomechanics
              literature as a viable solution. The primary purpose of this
              paper was to clarify that, for 1D biomechanics datasets, the
              distinction between 0D and 1D methods is much more important than
              the distinction between parametric and non-parametric procedures.
              A secondary purpose was to demonstrate that a parametric
              equivalent to the 1D bootstrap exists in the form of a random
              field theory (RFT) correction for multiple comparisons. To
              emphasize these points we analyzed six datasets consisting of
              force and kinematic trajectories in one-sample, paired,
              two-sample and regression designs. Results showed, first, that
              the 1D bootstrap and other 1D non-parametric CIs were
              qualitatively identical to RFT CIs, and all were very different
              from 0D CIs. Second, 1D parametric and 1D non-parametric
              hypothesis testing results were qualitatively identical for all
              six datasets. Last, we highlight the limitations of 1D CIs by
              demonstrating that they are complex, design-dependent, and thus
              non-generalizable. These results suggest that (i) analyses of 1D
              data based on 0D models of randomness are generally biased unless
              one explicitly identifies 0D variables before the experiment, and

              coracoacromial ligament, and coracoid process, during dynamic arm
              elevations through the entire range-of-motion. METHODS: Two
              healthy men performed maximum adduction, flexion, abduction, and
              extension with the arm internally, neutrally, and externally
              rotated. The distance between each rotator cuff footprint and the
              acromion, coracoacromial ligament, and coracoid process was
              measured from glenohumeral kinematics obtained from markers
              fitted to intracortical pins combined with the scapular and
              humeral 3D geometry obtained from CT-scan. RESULTS: All
              footprints moved to be less than 10 mm to the acromion,
              coracoacromial ligament and coracoid process. They got closer to
              the acromion than to the other parts of the coracoacromial arch.
              The acromion-supraspinatus and acromion-infraspinatus distances
              were minimal during abduction and flexion. The
              acromion-subscapularis distance was minimal when the arm was in

              there are s/g differences in anthropometrical and functional body

              shoulders of 6 healthy subjects were developed to calculate
              muscle and glenohumeral joint loading during abduction, flexion,
              horizontal flexion, nose touching and reaching using
              subject-specific, scaled-generic and generic musculotendon
              parameters. Muscle and glenohumeral joint forces calculated using
              generic and scaled-generic models were significantly different to
              those of subject-specific models (p<0.05), and task dependent;
              however, scaled-generic model calculations of shoulder
              glenohumeral joint force demonstrated better agreement with those
              of subject-specific models during abduction and flexion. Muscles
              in generic musculoskeletal models operated further from the
              plateau of their force-length curves than those of scaled-generic
              and subject-specific models, while muscles in subject-specific
              models operated over a wider region of their force length curves
              than those of the generic or scaled-generic models, reflecting
              diversity of subject shoulder strength. The findings of this
              study suggest that generic and scaled-generic musculotendon
              parameters may not provide sufficient accuracy in prediction of
              shoulder muscle and joint loading when compared to models that
              employ subject-specific parameter-estimation approaches.",

    abstract = "Abstract The purpose of this study was to provide information on
              physical work capacity during arm and shoulder lifting at various
              shoulder flexion and ad/abduction angles. We measured the maximum
              voluntary contractions (MVCs) in 20 male participants during
              controlled one-arm lifting. The lifting involved upward motion of
              the scapula at various shoulder angles. Simultaneously, the
              electromyographic (EMG) activity of 3 shoulder muscles and
              psychophysical workload were also recorded. The various
              measurements were compared to provide a multidimensional
              assessment of the physical work capacity of the shoulder at
              various working angles. In particular, 90 and 120 degrees of
              flexion, 30 degrees of adduction, and 90 degrees of abduction
              were found to be the most vulnerable angles based on the measured
              MVCs. The average root mean square value of the EMG increased
              most significantly at 90 to 150 degrees of flexion and at 30 and
              60 degrees of abduction. Slightly different measurements were
              compared to validate the results. In addition, a 3-D static
              biomechanical model was used to show whether the estimated
              shoulder workload matched the measured physical capacity of the
              shoulder. In conclusion, these results may help ergonomists to
              identify shoulder angles associated with a relatively high risk
              of injury, and to match the workload with the physical capacity
              of the shoulder. Task-specific information on shoulder work
              capacity is needed in the manufacturing and shipbuilding
              industries to protect workers from acute injuries and cumulative
              trauma disorders of the shoulder. Experimental results provide
              various data on shoulder work capacity during realistic
              multijoint arm and shoulder lifting, and should help lead to
              improvements in workplace ergonomic design. ? 2003 Wiley

              surgery, for optimizing implant design and fixation and for
              improving and verifying analytical biomechanical models of the
              shoulder. An instrumented shoulder implant with telemetric data
              transmission was developed to measure six components of joint
              contact forces and moments. A patient with humeral head arthrosis
              achieved good joint function after its implantation. During the
              first 7 postoperative months, the contact force remained below
              100\% BW (percent body weight) for most activities of daily
              living. It ranged up to 130\% BW for arm positions close to the
              limits of motion or when acting against external resistance. When
              the patient tried to turn a blocked steering wheel with maximum
              effort, the force rose to about 150\% BW, the highest level

              joint motions and in back loading variables (L5/S1 moments) exist
              during multiple box transfers. The task consisted in transferring
              24 15-kg boxes from one pallet to another (4 layers of boxes; 6
              boxes/layer: 3 in the front row, 3 in the back) at a
              self-determined pace and then at an imposed pace of 9 lifts/min.
              Full-body 3D kinematic data were collected as well as external
              foot forces. A dynamic 3D linked segment model was used to
              estimate the net moments at L5/S1. The results show that the peak
              L5/S1 moment during lifting for females was significantly lower
              than for males, but once normalized to body size the difference
              disappeared. In general, the female workers were very close to
              the posture adopted by the novice males at the instant of the
              peak resultant moment. However, females were closer to the box
              than the male workers. One major sex difference was seen when
              lifting from the ground, with the use of interjoint coordination
              analyses. Female workers showed a sequential motion initiated by
              the knees, followed by the hip and the back, while expert males
              showed a more synchronized motion. The lifting strategy of
              females likely stretches lumbar spine passive tissues, which in
              turn put them at greater risk of back injuries. As observed in
              our previous studies, these differences between expert males,
              novice males and females are especially notable when the box is
              lifted from the ground.",
